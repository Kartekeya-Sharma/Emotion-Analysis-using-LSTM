# Emotion-Recognition-from-Text

Abstract:

Emotion recognition from text is a burgeoning field within natural language processing (NLP) aimed at developing models capable of discerning and categorizing emotions expressed in written text. This project entails the creation of a predictive model designed to classify emotions, including happiness, sadness, and anger, among others, based on textual content. The process involves gathering labeled emotional text data, training a machine learning model, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and evaluating the model's accuracy on unseen data. Through this project, we aim to explore and implement state-of-the-art techniques in NLP to enhance our understanding of emotion recognition and its applications in various domains.
